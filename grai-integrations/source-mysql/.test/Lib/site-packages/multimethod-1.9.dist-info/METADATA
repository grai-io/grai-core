Multimethod provides a decorator for adding multiple argument dispatching to functions. The decorator creates a multimethod object as needed, and registers the function with its annotations.

There are several multiple dispatch libraries on PyPI. This one aims for simplicity and speed. With caching of argument types, it should be the fastest pure Python implementation possible.

## Usage
### multimethod
```python
from multimethod import multimethod

@multimethod
def func(x: int, y: float):
    ...
```

`func` is now a `multimethod` which will delegate to the above function, when called with arguments of the specified types. Subsequent usage will register new types and functions to the existing multimethod of the same name.

```python
@multimethod
def func(x: float, y: int):
    ...
```

Alternatively, functions can be explicitly registered in the same style as [functools.singledispatch](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.singledispatch). This syntax is also compatible with [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org), which by default checks that [each name is defined once](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/error_code_list.html#check-that-each-name-is-defined-once-no-redef).

```python
@func.register
def _(x: bool, y: bool):
    ...


@func.register(object, bool)
@func.register(bool, object)
def _(x, y):  # stackable without annotations
    ...
```

Multimethods are implemented as mappings from signatures to functions, and can be introspected as such.

```python
method[type, ...]           # get registered function
method[type, ...] = func    # register function by explicit types
```

Multimethods support any types that satisfy the `issubclass` relation, including abstract base classes in `collections.abc` and `typing`. Subscripted generics are supported:
* `Union[...]`
* `Mapping[...]` - the first key-value pair is checked
* `tuple[...]` - all args are checked
* `Iterable[...]` - the first arg is checked
* `Literal[...]`
* `Callable[[...], ...]` - parameter types are contravariant, return type is covariant

Naturally checking subscripts is slower, but the implementation is optimized, cached, and bypassed if no subscripts are in use in the parameter. Empty iterables match any subscript, but don't special-case how the types are normally resolved.

Dispatch resolution details:
* If an exact match isn't registered, the next closest method is called (and cached).
* If the `issubclass` relation is ambiguous,
[mro](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=mro#class.mro) position is used as a tie-breaker.
* If there are still ambiguous methods - or none - a custom `TypeError` is raised.
* Default and keyword-only parameters may be annotated, but won't affect dispatching.
* A skipped annotation is equivalent to `: object`.
* If no types are specified, it will inherently match all arguments.

`classmethod` and `staticmethod` may be used with a multimethod, but must be applied last, i.e., wrapping the final multimethod definition. For class and instance methods, `cls` and `self` participate in the dispatch as usual. They may be left blank when using annotations, otherwise use `object` as a placeholder.

```python
class Foo:
    @multimethod
    def bar(cls, x: str):
        ...

    @classmethod # <- only put this @classmethod here on the final definition
    @bar.register
    def _(cls, x: int):
        ...
```

### overload
Overloads dispatch on annotated predicates. Each predicate is checked in the reverse order of registration.

The implementation is separate from `multimethod` due to the different performance characteristics. If an annotation is a type instead of a predicate, it will be converted into an `isinstance` check.

```python
from multimethod import overload

@overload
def func(obj: str):
    ...

@overload
def func(obj: str.isalnum):
    ...

@overload
def func(obj: str.isdigit):
    ...
```

### multidispatch
`multidispatch` is a wrapper to provide compatibility with `functools.singledispatch`. It requires a base implementation and use of the `register` method instead of namespace lookup. It also provisionally supports dispatching on keyword arguments.

### multimeta

Use `metaclass=multimeta` to create a class with a special namespace which converts callables to multimethods, and registers duplicate callables with the original.

```python
from multimethod import multimeta

class Foo(metaclass=multimeta):
    def bar(self, x: str):
        ...
        
    def bar(self, x: int):
        ...
```

Equivalent to:

```python
from multimethod import multimethod

class Foo:
    @multimethod
    def bar(self, x: str):
        ...
        
    @bar.register
    def bar(self, x: int):
        ...
```
