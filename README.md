## Introduction

**Data lineage made simple.**
Grai makes it easy to understand how your data relates across databases, warehouses, APIs and dashboards.


* **Pre-built connectors.** Automatically synchronize lineage from across the stack so your metadata is never out of date.
* **Centralized data tests.** Write data validation tests which run whenever upstream data sources change (coming soon).
* **Integrated with git.** Run data validation tasks as part of your CI/CD process to test changes everywhere you data is used. No coordination meetings required.
* **Your data, your cloud.** Grai is fully open sourced and self hosted. You maintain full control over your data and hosting environment.
