## Introduction

**Data lineage made simple.**
Grai makes it easy to understand how your data relates together across databases, warehouses, APIs and dashboards.


* **Pre-built connectors.** Automatically synchronize lineage from across the stack so your metadata is never out of date.
* **Centralized data tests.** Write data validation tests which run whenever upstream data sources change (coming soon).
* **Integrated with git.** Run data validation tasks as part of your CI/CD process to test changes everywhere you data is used. No coordination meetings required.
* **Your data, your cloud.** Grai is fully open sourced and self hosted. You maintain full control over your data and hosting environment.


## Quick Start

```
git clone https://github.com/grai-io/grai-core
cd grai-core/grai-server
docker compose up
```

The server should now be available at [http://localhost:8000/admin](http://localhost:8000/admin).

Default login credentials:

```
username: null@grai.io
password: super_secret
```

You can also explore the API backend at [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs).

Check out this [guide](https://github.com/grai-io/grai-core/tree/master/examples/quick_start_postgres) for a walk through populating lineage using the postgres connector.

## Docker Image

Although you'll need to provide your own postgres container you can also get started with a basic image of Grai is
avaialable at `ghcr.io/grai-io/grai-core/grai-server`.
