## Default Configuration

The Web App depends on the Django framework and works with a variety of email backends.
You can find additional information about these configuration settings in the core Django documentation, see [https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/email/](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/email/).

You will need to set the following environment variables:

| Variable      | Value                                          |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| EMAIL_BACKEND | django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend |
| EMAIL_FROM    | Email address your emails will arrive from     |

## AWS SES Email

If you would like to use AWS's SES service to provision your emails you'll need to configure a few
additional environment variables.
