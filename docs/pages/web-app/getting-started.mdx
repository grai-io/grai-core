description: Grai server includes a front end web application available on the cloud or installed locally
---

The Web App provides a convenient way to interact with the Grai server, allowing you to view you data lineage, connect to data sources, and capture updates.


When self-hosted it's viewable by default at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) or through on the cloud at [https://app.grai.io](https://app.grai.io).

> To install the Web App locally follow the instructions in [quickstart](/quick-start).

## Logging In

To get started you will need a username and password.
You should contact your administrator for a workspace invite..

> If you installed Grai locally you should use the superuser you configured during installation.
> By default this be **null@grai.io** with the password **super_secret**

If you have forgotten your password, follow the link to reset it. This will only work on a local installation if you have [setup emails](/web-app/setup-emails).

> Invited to a workspace but can't see any information? You may need to switch workspaces. From the profile menu (top right) choose Change Workspace.

1. Go to Connections

2. Click Add Connection

5. Enter a name for your Connection

6. Enter the remaining required fields for the Connection

7. Save the Connection

8. Press Refresh on the Connection and wait for it to run

> If the run errors you should be able to see the errors by clicking on the status or the table row.

## Inviting users

It is easy to share access to the Grai Web App, so that the whole team can understand your data lineage.
