# Configuring Search

If appropriately configured, Grai has a powerful search function.


## Algolia

Grai search is powered by Algolia. To get started you will need to create an account on Algolia at [https://www.algolia.com/users/sign_up](https://www.algolia.com/users/sign_up).

You will need to set the following environment variables:

| Variable      | Value                                          |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| ALGOLIA_APPLICATION_ID | This is your unique application identifier. It's used to identify you when using Algolia's API. |
| ALGOLIA_ADMIN_KEY    | This is the ADMIN API key. Please keep it secret and use it ONLY from your backend: this key is used to create, update and DELETE your indices. You can also use it to manage your API keys. |
| ALGOLIA_SEARCH_KEY | This is the public API key to use in your frontend code. This key is only usable for search queries and sending data to the Insights API. |

## Indexing

To index your existing content, you will need to run the following command:

```bash
python manage.py algolia_reindex
```
