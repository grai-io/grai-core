# Introduction to Grai

Data lineage **finally** made simple.
Grai is the open source solution that makes it easy to understand how data relates across databases, warehouses, APIs and dashboards.

You can even check before merging PRs that changes aren't going to break your data pipelines. And its open-source.

Come and join us in [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/graicommunity/shared_invite/zt-1il70kfeb-TaCm5fwHg_quWCpKNYyj6w)

Or just get going!

```shell copy
git clone https://github.com/grai-io/grai-core.git
cd grai-core/examples/deployment/docker-compose/minimal
docker compose up
```

## Welcome to Grai

Grai is an open-source and self-hosted Data Lineage Platform, with a cloud hosted offering.
Designed and built for collaboration, Grai allows you to pick and choose the best data governance, observability, and reliability tools for your organization without sacrificing a single unified lineage model.

- **Pre-built integrations**. Automatically synchronize lineage from across the stack so your metadata is never out of date.
- **Centralized data tests**. Write data validation tests which run whenever upstream data sources change.
- **Integrated with GitHub**. Run data validation tasks as part of your CI/CD process to test changes everywhere you data is used. No coordination meetings required.
- **Your data, your cloud**. Grai is fully open-source and self-hosted. You maintain full control over your data and hosting environment.

## Quick Start Guide

Start managing your metadata and testing your pipelines in three easy steps [here](/quick-start). We walk through how to:

- Launch Grai server
- Using integrations for each of your data sources
- Update your server with source metadata

  This quickstart guide assumes a local installation, but Grai can be installed
  anywhere. Or come and [explore](https://app.grai.io/register/) on the cloud.
