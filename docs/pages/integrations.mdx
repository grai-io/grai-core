Although you can manually script the construction of Metadata for any application through combinations of the [REST API](/server/rest-api), [CLI](/tooling/cli), or [client library](/tooling/client) it's
generally more convenient to have official integrations which handle metadata extraction on your behalf.
Grai supports a number of integrations which can be used to automatically extract metadata from your application and which can be used both as standalone libraries or configured to run on the Web applicable

## New Integrations

We are constantly working on new integrations and if you have a specific integration you would like to see supported please create or vote on our [feature request page](https://github.com/orgs/grai-io/discussions/categories/feature-requests).
If you build your own integration please consider contributing it back to the open-source code base.


If you would like to contribute a new integration you can find reference material for getting started [here](/contributing/new-integrations).


### New Integration Support Policy

As a matter of policy, once an integration has been accepted into the Grai repository the core team will accept responsibility for long term maintenance.
This means that we will ensure that the integration continues to work with the latest versions of Grai and that we will fix any bugs that are reported against the integration.
