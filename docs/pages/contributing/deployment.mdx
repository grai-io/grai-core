# Deployment

Once you have a clone of the core repository you can begin active development.

## Dependencies

1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
2. [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
3. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

## Running the Server and frontend

We maintain an up to date docker-compose script for development purposes under
the `grai-server` folder of the monorepo.
In order to deploy an instance locally you can do the following

```shell copy
cd grai-core/grai-server
docker compose up
```

It may take a minute for all of the services to deploy depending on your machine
so give it a moment but you will soon have access to an instance of the server
running at `localhost:8000` and the frontend on `localhost:3000`.

The default login credentials are

```copy
username: null@grai.io
password: super_secret
```

### Services

Grai relies on the following background services.

- [PostgresQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) as the core database
- [Redis](https://redis.com/) for cacheing
- [Celery](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/periodic-tasks.html) for job scheduling and worker execution
- [Flower](https://flower.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for monitoring of Celery tasks
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) for our backend web framework

The frontend is [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/)

## Integrations

You'll find all of the integration code under the `grai-integrations` directory.
Each is a python application which you can install locally without any dependencies other than python.
However, we use poetry extensively for managing our libraries.

We will be using the postgres integration as an example below but all of this is equally
applicable to the other python libraries and integrations.

### Installing a dev environment

Although all of our python libraries are directly installable through pip

```shell copy
cd grai-core/grai-integrations/source-postgres
pip install -e .
```

We recommend using poetry to manage your installations like so.

```shell copy
cd grai-core/grai-integrations/source-postgres
poetry install
```

This will create a new virtual environment with all required dependencies for the integration.
You can run command inside this virtual environment by prefixing commands with `poetry run`,
e.g. `poetry run python` will place in you the python interpreter for your environment.

### Testing

We use pytest in all of our python applications and you can run tests in your
virtual environment with this command.

```shell copy
poetry run pytest
```

Some integrations might depend on a database instance in which case there will be a
docker-compose file in the root of the integration subdirectory.
In these cases you should use Docker to spin up an instance of the needed containers
before running the test commands.

```shell copy
docker compose up
poetry run pytest
```

### Continuous Integration

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  GitHub Actions definition files are available in the root directory of the
  project under `.github/workflows`
</Callout>

Each of these testing steps will run a CI job built using GitHub Actions.
For new integrations we ask that you add an action which runs Linting, and unit tests
on every pull request.

## Miscellaneous

### Style Guide

Our Python libraries all follow a consistent style guide consisting of

- [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for linting
  - We use a line-width of 120 characters not 81
- [MyPy](https://github.com/python/mypy) for static type checking
- [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) for standardized import ordering

### Pre-Commit

There are pre-commit hooks available across the repository.
If you're unfamiliar with pre-commit hooks you don't need to worry about this
though you can find out more about them [here](https://pre-commit.com/).
