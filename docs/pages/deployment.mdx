# Deployment

Grai is generally deployed as a containerized application consisting of two core components.
Although building from source is possible, we recommend using the pre-built docker images.

## Server

- Postgres + Django
- Redis
- Celery + Celery Beat
- flower

For more information about the server see [Grai Server](/server/).

## Web App

For more information about the web app see [Grai Web App](/web-app/)

## Container Registry

We maintain up to date docker images for all of the Grai services on GitHub's Container Registry `ghcr`
