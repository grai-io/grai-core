# Grai Server

Grai relies on the following background services.

- [PostgresQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) as the core database
- [Redis](https://redis.com/) for cacheing
- [Celery](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/periodic-tasks.html) for job scheduling and worker execution
- [Flower](https://flower.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for monitoring of Celery tasks
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) for our backend web framework

You'll find the default admin login credentials below but these should be changed immediately in a production setting.

```copy
username: null@grai.io
password: super_secret
```
