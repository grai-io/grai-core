# GraphQL API

The GraphQL API is the primary mechanism used by the web app to communicate with the server.
It is also available for use by third-party applications, however, it is prone to changing without notice.
If you need a stable interface for development you should use the [REST API](/server/rest-api/).


## GraphQL Playground

We maintain a GraphQL Playground instance [here]("https://api.grai.io/graphql/").
This is a great way to explore the API and test out queries and mutations.
