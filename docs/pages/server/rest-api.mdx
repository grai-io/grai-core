# REST API

The REST API is supported primarily for third party applications.
It also back many of the secondary tools like the client library, cli, and some CI components like GitHub Actions.
If you need a stable interface for development this is the place to look

## Authentication

The REST API supports three authentication modes.

* Basic Auth (username/password)
* API key Auth
* JWT Auth

### Basic Auth

Basic Auth is the simplest form of authentication.
It is supported by most HTTP clients and is easy to use.

In order to use Basic Auth you will need to pass the username and password as the username and password of the HTTP request.


### API Key Auth

Each API key is associated with an individual user and workspace.
In order to get started you'll need to first create an API key in the web app.
Once you have a key calls to the REST API will look for an `Api-Key` header with the value of your API key.
e.g.

```bash
curl -X POST \
-H "Authorization: Api-Key {your_api_key}" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \
...
```


## REST Playground

We maintain two playgrounds for the REST API alongside [openapi specs](https://api.grai.io/api/v1/schema/) for the most recent version of the API.

* [**Redoc**](https://api.grai.io/api/v1/schema/redoc/)
* [**Swagger UI**](https://api.grai.io/api/v1/schema/swagger-ui/)

In order to actually perform queries you will need to register on the cloud and authenticate against the API.
