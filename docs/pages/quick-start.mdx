# Quick Start

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  This quickstart guide assumes a local installation, but Grai can be installed
  anywhere. Or come and [explore](https://app.grai.io/register/) on the cloud.
</Callout>

## What we'll cover here

In order to build your data lineage chart you will need to run Grai server and client, and download metadata from your data tools.

This will take less than five minutes and involves three easy steps:

- Launch the Grai Server
- Install the Grai Connector for your data sources
- Update the server with your source metadata

### Step 1: Clone the repository and run locally

```shell copy
git clone https://github.com/grai-io/grai-core.git
cd grai-core/grai-server
docker compose up
```

This sets up three containers running

- (1) an instance of postgres running on port 5432
- (2) an api server running on 8000 which you should see it available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) and
- (3) your frontend at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

These settings are all configurable.

Your default login credentials, are:

```copy
username: null@grai.io
password: super_secret
```

### Step 2: Pick your data source and install out-of-the-box integrations:

For this example

```shell copy
pip install grai-source-postgres
```

### Step 3: Update the server with your source metadata:

The integration comes equipped with the client library already but we will need a python terminal or Jupyter Notebook to execute a few commands to establish a connection and begin querying the server.

Spin up your favorite python terminal then:

```python copy
import os
from grai_source_postgres.base import update_server
from grai_client.endpoints.v1.client import ClientV1
```

For now we will use the default user credentials though you are free to create a new user / api keys from the server admin interface at http://localhost:8000/admin.

```python copy
client = ClientV1(host='localhost', port='8000', insecure=True, username="null@grai.io", password="super_secret")
```

Now we can update the server with data from any postgres source.
In order to do so you will need to pass credentials and namespace into the update_server function.
Namespace is used to uniquely identify the nodes and when used consistently will allow you to add to the node from any source.

Using example variables, in order to update the server with your metadata, simply run:

```python copy
update_server(client, dbname='grai', user='grai', password='grai', namespace='default', host='localhost', port='8000')
```

## Using Lineage

Once your nodes and edges are setup, you can go ahead and use your lineage!
