# Cloud Security

Grai Cloud is a managed instance of Grai running on Grai's infrastructure. Grai Cloud is designed to be secure by default, and Grai takes a number of steps to ensure that your data is secure.

When you connect Grai Cloud to your data stores and tools, you may need to configure your security settings to allow Grai access to your infrastructure. There are a number of ways to give Grai access to your infrastructure, and the best option will depend on your security requirements.
