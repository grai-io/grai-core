# Cloud Security

Grai Cloud is a managed instance of Grai and offers the same sets of security features as Grai.
The primary difference is that Grai Cloud is managed by Grai and hosted on Grai's infrastructure.

Users of Grai Cloud are responsible for configuring their own security settings and policies to insure we can access any needed services within your infrastructure.
You can find more information about possible configuration settings here.

## Multi-tenancy

If you need a dedicated instance of Grai, please [contact us](https://calendly.com/grai-founders/intro) to discuss your requirements.
Otherwise, Grai Cloud is a multi-tenant service and your data is logically separated from other customers.
