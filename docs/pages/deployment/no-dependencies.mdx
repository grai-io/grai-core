# Deploy from source

If you don't have access to Docker or don't want to use it, you can still run Grai using sqlite.
This is not recommended for production use, but it's fine for development purposes.

## Prerequisites

Insure the machine you're attempting to run Grai on has access to all of the following

* Access to Grai's source code
* Python 3.8 or higher
* Either `pip` or `poetry`, and `npm`
* sqlite3


## Caveats and Disclaimers

This guide is not intended for production use.
We primarily support containerized deployments using docker and kubernetes and we generally recommend you use one
of those methods.
If you're unable to use either this guide can be helpful for development purposes though it will not represent a fully
functional Grai deployment as it does not include dependencies like celery and redis.


## Installation

<Steps>
### Gather source code
You'll first need to clone Grai's source code. You can do this with the following command:

```bash
git clone https://www.github.com/grai-io/grai-core
cd grai-core
```

### Prepare the Server

You'll need to install Grai's server dependencies.
If you have `pip` installed, you can do this with the following command:

```bash
cd grai-server
pip install .
```

The server dependencies are now ready.

#### Prepare the Database

<Callout emoji="ðŸ‘¾">
    It might be convenient to create a `.env` file in the `grai-core/grai-server/app` directory with the `DB_ENGINE`
    variable set to `django.db.backends.sqlite3`. That way you won't need to run export in every new shell you open.
</Callout>


We will be using sqlite for the database where by default Grai uses postgres so we will need to set the environment
variable `DB_ENGINE` to `django.db.backends.sqlite3`.

```bash
export DB_ENGINE=django.db.backends.sqlite3
```

We can now runt the development server.

```bash
cd app
python manage.py runserver --settings the_guide.settings.dev --nostatic
```

At this point you should see a message indicating that the server is running on port 8000 and that you have unapplied migrations.
Our next step is to run the migrations.
To do that you'll need to open a new shell in the app directory and run the following command (don't forget to set the
`DB_ENGINE` env variable):

```bash
python manage.py migrate --settings the_guide.settings.dev
```

Finally, we need to create a superuser so we can log into the admin panel.

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser --settings the_guide.settings.dev
```

You should now be able to load the admin panel at `http://localhost:8000/admin` and log in with the credentials you just created.

### Prepare the Web App

<Callout emoji="ðŸ‘¾" type="warning">
    It's unlikely the web app will function without redis, however, you should be able to see the login screen.
    The server on the other hand, ought to function just fine, allowing you to run integrations and retrieve results
    using the API, CLI, and integration libraries.
</Callout>

We will now move over to building and deploying the web app.
Start by moving to the web app directory.

```bash
cd ../../grai-frontend
```

#### Install Dependencies

You can install the web apps dependencies with npm.
```bash
npm install
```

#### Run the Web App

You are now ready to run web app with npm.

```bash
npm run start
```

The web app will now be available and running at http://localhost:3000.

### Deploying Redis

If you're a truly motivated person you can deploy redis to get the web app working.
Redis provides canonical documentation for deployment from source on their [website](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/installation/install-redis-from-source/).

The server will look for an instance of redis running on port `6379` by default.
