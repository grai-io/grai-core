# Introduction

Grai consists of multiple different independent services including

### Server

- Postgres + Django
- Redis
- Celery + Celery Beat
- flower

For more information about the server see [Grai Server](/server/).

### Web App

For more information about the web app see [Grai Web App](/web-app/)

### Container Registry

We maintain up to date docker images for all of the Grai services on GitHub's Container Registry `ghcr`

| Service | Image                                   | Tags           |
| ------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Server  | ghcr.io/grai-io/grai-core/grai-server   | latest, semver |
| Web App | ghcr.io/grai-io/grai-core/grai-frontend | latest, semver |

## Deployment

### Dependencies

Before you begin, make sure have access to both `docker` and `docker-compose` on your machine.

<Callout>
  If you haven't used Docker before, we recommend you check out the [Docker
  Getting Started Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/). For more
  installation about Docker Compose, see the [Docker Compose Installation
  Guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). If you are on Windows, you
  may need to install
  [WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) to run
  Docker.
</Callout>

### Running the Server and frontend

We maintain a variety of up to date docker-compose deployment scripts in version control [here](https://github.com/grai-io/grai-core/tree/master/examples/deployment/docker-compose).
Which you can always use for reference.

#### Minimal

The minimal configuration is a good starting point for testing out Grai.
It's composed of only the bare minimum number of services required to run the server and frontend.
You can find a reference to the minimal configuration [here](https://github.com/grai-io/grai-core/blob/master/examples/deployment/docker-compose/minimal/docker-compose.yml).

This will provide a fully functional instance of the Grai application although some of the features like scheduled tasks may operate with reduced functionality.

#### Complete

The complete configuration contains all of the services required to run the full Grai application.
You can find a reference to the complete configuration [here](https://github.com/grai-io/grai-core/blob/master/examples/deployment/docker-compose/complete/docker-compose.yml)

#### Deploying

Once you've decided which configuration you want to use you can deploy it by running the following steps.

<Steps>
#### Copy the `docker-compose.yml` file

Open a terminal and navigate to whichever directory you intend to work from.
Then copy your intended `docker-compose.yml` file into the work directory of your terminal

e.g. if you want to use the minimal configuration you would copy the following content into your compose file.

```yaml copy
version: "3.7"

services:
  db:
    image: postgres:14.3-alpine
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=grai
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=grai
      - POSTGRES_DB=grai
    ports:
      - 5432:5432
    healthcheck:
      test: "pg_isready -U grai"
      interval: 2s
      timeout: 2s
      retries: 15

  the_guide:
    image: ghcr.io/grai-io/grai-core/grai-server:latest
    ports:
      - 8000:8000
    environment:
      - DB_HOST=db
      - DB_PORT=5432
      - DB_NAME=grai
      - DB_USER=grai
      - DB_PASSWORD=grai
    depends_on:
      - db
      - redis
    healthcheck:
      test: "curl -f -v -H 'Accept: application/json' http://localhost:8000/health/"
      interval: 2s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 10
      start_period: 20s

  frontend:
    image: ghcr.io/grai-io/grai-core/grai-frontend:latest
    ports:
      - 3000:80
    environment:
      - REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
    depends_on:
      - the_guide

  redis:
    image: redis/redis-stack:latest
    environment:
      - REDISGRAPH_ARGS=RESULTSET_SIZE 100000
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 6379:6379
      - 8001:8001
```

#### docker compose up

Once you've copied the compose file into your work directory you can run `docker-compose up` to start the services.

```bash copy
docker-compose up
```

It may take a few minutes for the services to start up but once they are running you should be able to access the frontend at `http://localhost:3000` and the server at `http://localhost:8000`.

Under the default configuration, an admin user will be created with the following credentials.

| Username     | Password     |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| null@grai.io | super_secret |

</Steps>
