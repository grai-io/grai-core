Grai allows you to run a test of your data changes in git using GitHub Actions.

In your repository, create a yaml file at `/.github/workflows/main.yml`
and populate the file with your action parameters.

The full documentation for supported actions can be found in [GitHub](https://github.com/grai-io/grai-actions)
The example below works with postgres though there are equivalent implementations for
each other integration including dbt, MySQL, snowflake, etc...

```yaml copy
on: pull_request

jobs:
  test:
    name: Evaluate local actions
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: prod data
        uses: grai-io/grai-actions/postgres@master
        with:
          api-key: "[your grai api key]"
          namespace: "[integration namespace]"
          db-host: "[host for your grai instance]"
          db-port: "[port for your grai instance]"
          db-user: "[database user]"
          db-password: "[database user password]"
```
