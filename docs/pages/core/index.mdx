## Welcome to Grai

Grai is an open-source and self-hosted Data Lineage Platform, with a cloud hosted offering.
Designed and built for collaboration, Grai allows you to pick and choose the best data governance, observability, and reliability tools for your organization without sacrificing a single unified lineage model.

- **Pre-built integrations**. Automatically synchronize lineage from across the stack so your metadata is never out of date.
- **Centralized data tests**. Write data validation tests which run whenever upstream data sources change.
- **Integrated with Github**. Run data validation tasks as part of your CI/CD process to test changes everywhere you data is used. No coordination meetings required.
- **Your data, your cloud**. Grai is fully open-source and self-hosted. You maintain full control over your data and hosting environment.
