# Getting Started

The Web App provides a convenient way to interact with the Grai server, allowing you to view you data lineage, connect to data sources, and capture updates.

When self-hosted it's viewable by default at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) or through on the cloud at [https://app.grai.io](https://app.grai.io).

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  To install the Web App locally follow the instructions in
  [quickstart](/core/quick-start).
</Callout>

## Logging In

To get started you will need a username and password.
You should contact your administrator for a workspace invite..

  If you installed Grai locally you should use the superuser you configured
  during installation. By default this be **null@grai.io** with the password
  **super_secret**
</Callout>

If you have forgotten your password, follow the link to reset it. This will only work on a local installation if you have [setup emails](/core/web-app/setup-emails).

## Creating your first connection

1. Go to Connections

2. Click Add Connection

5. Enter a name for your Connection

6. Enter the remaining required fields for the Connection

7. Save the Connection

8. Press Refresh on the Connection and wait for it to run

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">

  status or the table row.

## Inviting users

It is easy to share access to the Grai Web App, so that the whole team can understand your data lineage.
