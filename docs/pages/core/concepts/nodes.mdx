# Nodes

Nodes are the first concept to understand about your data lineage graph.
They can represent anything in your data pipeline from columns and tables to BI dashboards and API endpoints.
By combining them together we can build a graph representing the relationship between data throughout your organization.
Most out of the box integrations concentrate on representing tables, views and columns, however, they can represent whatever you need simply by using the [client](/core/tooling/client) to communicate with the server.

This flexibility is, in part, the power of Grai - a node can be anything, limited only by your needs and imagination.
