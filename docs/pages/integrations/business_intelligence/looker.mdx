The Looker integration synchronizes your Dashboards and LookML from Looker into Grai
In this way you can quickly identify which data is being used by your BI tools, which data is not, and more.

| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| source    | The name of the source, see [sources](/concepts/sources)           | my-source |
| Name            | Name for connection                                                | Looker   |
| Namespace       | Namespace for the connection, see [namespace](/concepts/namespace) | default  |
| base_url        | Base url of your looker instance                                   |          |
| client_id       | Client ID for the Looker API                                       |          |
| client_secret   | Client Secret for the Looker API                                   |          |
| namespaces      | An Optional JSON string (see below)                                |          |

You can find more information about generating a client id and secret [here](https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/admin-panel-users-users#api_keys).

#### Namespaces

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  If the namespaces field is not provided, Grai will create a default namespace for each Explore on your behalf.
  You can always update the namespaces field later to customize your namespace organization.
</Callout>

In order to automatically tie your data lineage together, Grai needs to know which Grai namespace corresponds to each lookML model.
The namespaces field should be a JSON string with the Grai namespace for each dashboard id e.g.

```json
{
    "<model>": "<namespace>"
}
```


## Python Library

### Installation

Install the Looker Grai integration with pip

```shell copy
pip install grai_source_looker
```

More information about the API is available [here](/api-docs/grai_source_looker/base).

### Example

The library is split into a few distinct functions but if you only wish to extract nodes/edges you can do
so as follows:

```python copy
from grai_source_looker.base import LookerIntegration

integration = LookerIntegration(base_url=<your_url>,
                                client_id=<your_client_id>,
                                client_secret=<your_client_secret>,
                                namespace=<your_namespace>,
)
nodes, edges = integration.get_nodes_and_edges()
client.post([nodes, edges])
```
