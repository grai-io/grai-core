The Metabase integration synchronizes your Metabase Question metadata into the lineage graph.
In this way you can quickly identify which data is being used by your BI tools, which data is not, and more.

### Fields

| Field           | Value                                                              | Example  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| Name            | Name for connection                                                | Metabase |
| Namespace       | Namespace for the connection, see [namespace](/concepts/namespace) | default  |
| username        | Username for an authorized Metabase User                           |          |
| password        | Password of the authorized user                                    |          |
| namespaces      | An Optional JSON string (see below)                                |          |
| endpoint        | Optional endpoint if self-hosting fivetran                          |          |

#### Namespaces

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  If the namespaces field is not provided, Grai will create a default namespace for each databases on your behalf.
  You can always update the namespaces field later to customize your namespace organization.
</Callout>

Metabase stores a database id for every database it's configured to query from.
In order to automatically tie your data lineage together, Grai needs to know which Grai namespace corresponds to each database id.
The namespaces field should be a JSON string with the Grai namespace for each database id e.g.

```json
{
    "<database_id>": "<namespace>"
}
```


## Python Library

### Installation

Install the Metabase Grai integration with pip

```shell copy
pip install grai-source-metabase
```

This installs the Grai Metabase integration, which is now ready to run in python

### Connecting & Syncing

The integration comes equipped with the client library already but we will need a python terminal or Jupyter Notebook to execute a few commands to establish a connection and begin querying the server.

Spin up your favorite python terminal then:

```python copy
import os
from grai_source_metabase.base import update_server
```

For now we will use the default user credentials though you are free to create a new user / api keys from the server admin interface at http://localhost:8000/admin.

```python copy
client = ClientV1("localhost", "8000", username="null@grai.io", password="super_secret")
```

Using example variables, in order to update the server with your metadata, simply run:

```python copy
update_server(client, metabase_namespace=[your_metabase_namespace], username=[your_username], password=[your_password], endpoint=[your_endpoint])
```
