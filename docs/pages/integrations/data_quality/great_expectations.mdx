The Great Expectations integration uses OpenLineage to collect and send metadata to Grai.
Complete documentation for integrating OpenLineage with Great Expectations can be found [here](https://openlineage.io/docs/integrations/great-expectations/).


## Web App

You'll also need to create a new Grai source in the web app.
You can create a generic OpenLineage integration by selecting the OpenLineage source type.

### Webhook

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  In order to authenticate your webhook, you will need to create an API key in
  the Grai web app.
</Callout>

Grai will open an endpoint at `/api/v1/openlineage/<connection_id>/` which can be used to receive OpenLineage events.

The official [OpenLineage docs](https://openlineage.io/docs/integrations/great-expectations/) have more information on how to configure your instance to send OpenLineage events to Grai.
However, you can use these values to finish your configuration:

An example config:

```env copy
OPENLINEAGE_URL - https://api.grai.io/api/v1/openlineage/<connection_id>/
OPENLINEAGE_API_KEY - "<your_grai_api_key>"
```

If you're self-hosting Grai, you'll need to replace the URL with your own instance.
