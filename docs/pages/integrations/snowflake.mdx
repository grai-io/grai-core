## Python Library

### Installation

Install Snowflake Grai package with pip

```shell copy
pip install grai-source-snowflake
```

This installs the Grai snowflake integration, which is now ready to run in python

### Connecting & Syncing

The integration comes equipped with the client library already but we will need a python terminal or Jupyter Notebook to execute a few commands to establish a connection and begin querying the server.

Spin up your favorite python terminal then:

```python copy
import os
from grai_source_snowflake.base import update_server
```

For now we will use the default user credentials though you are free to create a new user / api keys from the server admin interface at http://localhost:8000/admin.

```python copy
client = ClientV1("localhost","8000")
client.set_authentication_headers("null@grai.io","super_secret")
```

Now we can update the server with data from any snowflake source. In order to do so you will need to pass credentials and namespace into the update_server function. Namespace is used to uniquely identify the nodes and when used consistently will allow you to add to the node from any source.

Using example variables, in order to update the server with your metadata, simply run:

```python copy
update_server(client, account="[your_account]", user="[your_user]]", password="[your_password]", role="[your_role]", warehouse="COMPUTE_WH", database="GRAI", schema="JAFFLE_SHOP", namespace="test")

```
