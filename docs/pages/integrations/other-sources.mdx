# Other Sources

We are constantly adding new integrations, and the docs may not always be up to date, so if you are looking for something that isn't covered here then check the [github](https://github.com/grai-io/grai-core/tree/master/grai-integrations) repo for integrations.

You can also request a new integration anytime by joining the [slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/graicommunity/shared_invite/zt-1il70kfeb-TaCm5fwHg_quWCpKNYyj6w).

If you're unable to find an integration for your tool it's always possible to build custom integrations on top of the python [client](/tooling/client).

## Building a Custom Integration

Finally, if you build a integration, consider contributing it to the open-source code base.
If a contribution is accepted into the core codebase the Grai team will continue to maintain long-term support for the integration.
Join us in slack to find out more.
