# Other Sources

We are constantly adding new integrations, and the docs may not always be up to date, so if you are looking for something that isn't covered here then check the [github](https://github.com/grai-io/grai-core/tree/master/grai-integrations) repo for integrations.

You can also request a new integration anytime by joining the [slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/graicommunity/shared_invite/zt-1il70kfeb-TaCm5fwHg_quWCpKNYyj6w).

In addition, any new data can easily be written to your grai server simply by using the [client](/core/tooling/client) provided, without needing an official integration.
Finally, if you build a integration, consider contributing it to the open-source code base.
Contributions which are accepted into the core codebase will continue to receive support from the Grai team long term.
Join us in slack to find out more.
