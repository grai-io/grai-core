# Flat File

The Flat File integration is used to upload a single flat file (like csv, parquet, and feather) into the data lineage graph.

## Web App

### Fields

| Field     | Value                                                               | Example |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Namespace | Namespace for the connection, see [namespaces](/concepts/namespace) | default |

## Python Library

### Installation

Install Flat File Grai package with pip

```shell copy
pip install grai-source-flatfile
```

### Connecting & Syncing

The integration comes equipped with the client library already but we will need a python terminal or Jupyter Notebook to execute a few commands to establish a connection and begin querying the server.

Spin up your favorite python terminal then:

```python copy
import os
from grai_source_flatfile.base import update_server
```

For now we will use the default user credentials though you are free to create a new user / api keys from the server admin interface at http://localhost:8000/admin.

```python copy
client = ClientV1("localhost","8000")
client.set_authentication_headers("null@grai.io","super_secret")
```

Now we can update the server with data from any postgres source. In order to do so you will need to pass credentials and namespace into the update_server function. Namespace is used to uniquely identify the nodes and when used consistently will allow you to add to the node from any source.

```python copy
update_server(client, [flat_file fields])
```
