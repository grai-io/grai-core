The BigQuery integration synchronizes metadata from your BigQuery datawarehouse into the data lineage graph.

### Fields

| Field              | Value                                                                 | Example         |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| source    | The name of the source, see [sources](/concepts/sources)           | my-source |
| Name               | Name for connection                                                   | Google BigQuery |
| Namespace          | Namespace for the connection, see [namespaces](/concepts/namespace)   | default         |
| project            | GCP project id                                                        | grai-demo       |
| dataset            | BigQuery Dataset Id, or multiple datasets seperated by a comma (`,`)  | jaffle_shop     |
| credentials        | JSON credentials for service account, see [Credentials](#credentials) |                 |
| Log Parsing        | Choose to enable log parsing, see [Lod Parsing](#log-parsing)         |                 |
| Log Parsing Window | The number of days to read logs from, see [Log Parsing](#log-parsing) | 7               |

### Credentials

1. Create a service account [https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts).

2. Add the following permissions to your service account:

- BigQuery Data Viewer
- BigQuery Job User

3. Generate json credentials for your service account [https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials#service-account](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials#service-account).

4. Copy and paste the json into the [credentials] field.

### Log Parsing

Optionally the BigQuery integration can read logs from BigQuery to determine which tables are related to each other.

You will need to grant the service account the following additional permission:

- Logs Viewer

Logs are read over a window of one or more days, to capture relevant database logs. For example if you have a daily batch job, you could set the window to one day.

## Python Library

The BigQuery integration can be run as a standalone python library to extract data lineage from your BigQuery warehouse.
The library is available via pip


```shell copy
pip install grai_source_bigquery
```

More information about the API is available [here](/api-docs/grai_source_bigquery/base).

### Example

The library is split into a few distinct functions but if you only wish to extract nodes/edges from BigQuery you can do
so from the base BigQueryIntegration class.

```python copy
  from grai_source_bigquery import BigQueryIntegration
  from grai_schemas.v1.source import SourceV1

  source = SourceV1(name="my-source", type="my-type")
  big_query_settings = {
    "project": "my-project",
    "dataset": "my-dataset
    "credentials": "my-credentials-json",
  }
  integration = BigQueryIntegration(source=source, namespace="BigQuery", **big_query_settings)

  nodes, edges = integration.get_nodes_and_edges()
```
