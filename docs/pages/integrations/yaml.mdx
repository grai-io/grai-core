Every aspect of Grai can be serialized to yaml.
This allows you to manage your entire data lineage as code, backup your lineage in version control, or create and edit nodes/edges in code.
You can find explicit yaml definitions for all Grai objects in the grai-schemas library.
Documentation for the schemas can be found [here](/api-docs/grai_schemas/v1/edge).
## Web App

The YAML File integration is used to upload a single YAML file, which needs to have the correct Grai format.

## CLI

You can create, edit, and delete lineage in yaml through the CLI.
Let's say you wanted to add an `is_really_important` flag to the metadata on the `customer_id` column of the `customers` table.
In that case we might write a yaml definition like this

```yaml copy
type: Node
version: v1
spec:
  name: "customers.customer_id"
  namespace: default
  is_active: true
  metadata:
    grai:
      node_type: Column
    is_really_important: true
```

We could then update the server with this new information through the CLI

```shell copy
grai apply <node_file>
```

You can do the same with edges

```yaml copy
version: v1
type: Edge
spec:
  source:
    name: public.lineage_node.id
    namespace: default
  destination:
    name: node2
    namespace: test
  is_active: true
  metadata:
    grai:
      edge_type: "Edge"
    stuff: goes_here
```
