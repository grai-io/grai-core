# Flat File

The Flat File integration is used to upload a single flat file (like csv, parquet, and feather) into the data lineage graph.

## Web App

### Fields

| Field     | Value                                                               | Example |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| source    | The name of the source, see [sources](/concepts/sources)           | my-source |
| Namespace | Namespace for the connection, see [namespaces](/concepts/namespace) | default |

## Python Library

The dbt integration can be run as a standalone python library to extract data lineage from flat files like csv and parquet.

The library is available via pip


```shell copy
pip install grai_source_flat_file
```

More information about the API is available [here](/api-docs/grai_source_flat_file/base).

### Example

The library is split into a few distinct functions but if you only wish to extract nodes/edges you can do
so as follows:

```python copy
  from grai_source_flat_file import FlatFileIntegration
  from grai_schemas.v1.source import SourceV1

  source = SourceV1(name="my-source", type="my-type")

  integration = FlatFileIntegration(source=source, namespace="dbt", file_name="/path/to/file.csv")

  nodes, edges = integration.get_nodes_and_edges()
```
