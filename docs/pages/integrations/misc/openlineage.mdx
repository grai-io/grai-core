### Webhook

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  In order to authenticate your webhook, you will need to create an API key in
  the Grai web app.
</Callout>

Grai will open an endpoint at `/api/v1/openlineage/<connection_id>/` which can be used to receive OpenLineage events. You should point your OpenLineage clients to this endpoint.

See the [OpenLineage docs](https://openlineage.io/docs/client/python) for how to configure your client to send events to a webhook.

An example config:

```yaml copy
transport:
  type: "http"
  url: "https://api.grai.io"
  endpoint: "api/v1/openlineage/<connection_id>/"
  auth:
    type: "api_key"
    api_key: "<your_grai_api_key>"
```

## Python Library

The OpenLineage integration can be run as a standalone python library to convert OpenLineage events into Grai objects.

The library is available via pip

```shell copy
pip install grai_source_openlineage
```

More information about the API is available [here](/api-docs/grai_source_openlineage/base).

### Example

The library is split into a few distinct functions but if you only wish to extract nodes/edges you can do
so as follows:

```python copy
  from grai_source_openlineage import OpenLineageIntegration
  from grai_schemas.v1.source import SourceV1

  source = SourceV1(name="my-source", type="my-type")
  openlineage_params = {
    "namespaces": {}
  }

  integration = OpenLineageIntegration(source=source, namespace="openlineage", **openlineage_params)

  nodes, edges = integration.get_nodes_and_edges()
```

In this case, we are putting all nodes and edges produced by OpenLineage in a single namespace.
In practice you usually don't want to do this because it will result in overlapping id's.
For example, an OpenLineage connection copying data from a source table `my_table` to a destination table `my_table` will
result in two nodes with the same id.

To avoid this, you can pass a `namespaces` parameter to the `OpenLineageIntegration` constructor which will map OpenLineage
namespaces to source and destination Grai namespaces.

```python copy
    namespaces = {<openlineage_namespace>: <grai_namepsace>}
    integration = OpenLineageIntegration(source=source, namespaces=namespaces)
```
