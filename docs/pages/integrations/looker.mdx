The Looker integration synchronizes your Dashboards and LookML from Looker into Grai
In this way you can quickly identify which data is being used by your BI tools, which data is not, and more.

### Fields

| Field           | Value                                                              | Example  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| Source | Name of the source for this connection | Looker |
| Name            | Name for connection                                                | Looker   |
| Namespace       | Namespace for the connection, see [namespace](/concepts/namespace) | default  |
| base_url        | Base url of your looker instance                                   |          |
| client_id       | Client ID for the Looker API                                       |          |
| client_secret   | Client Secret for the Looker API                                   |          |
| namespaces      | An Optional JSON string (see below)                                |          |

You can find more information about generating a client id and secret [here](https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/admin-panel-users-users#api_keys).

#### Namespaces

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  If the namespaces field is not provided, Grai will create a default namespace for each Explore on your behalf.
  You can always update the namespaces field later to customize your namespace organization.
</Callout>

In order to automatically tie your data lineage together, Grai needs to know which Grai namespace corresponds to each lookML model.
The namespaces field should be a JSON string with the Grai namespace for each dashboard id e.g.

```json
{
    "<model>": "<namespace>"
}
```


## Python Library

### Installation

Install the Metabase Grai integration with pip

```shell copy
pip install grai-source-looker
```

This installs the Grai Looker integration, which is now ready to run in python

### Connecting & Syncing

The integration comes equipped with the client library already but we will need a python terminal or Jupyter Notebook to execute a few commands to establish a connection and begin querying the server.

Spin up your favorite python terminal then:

```python copy
import os
from grai_source_looker.base import LookerIntegration
```

For now we will use the default user credentials though you are free to create a new user / api keys from the server admin interface at http://localhost:8000/admin.

```python copy
client = ClientV1("localhost", "8000", username="null@grai.io", password="super_secret")
```

Using example variables, in order to update the server with your metadata, simply run:

```python copy
from grai_source_looker.base import LookerIntegration

integration = LookerIntegration(base_url=<your_url>,
                                client_id=<your_client_id>,
                                client_secret=<your_client_secret>,
                                namespace=<your_namespace>,
)
nodes, edges = integration.get_nodes_and_edges()
client.post([nodes, edges])
```
