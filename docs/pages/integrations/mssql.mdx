The SQL Server integration synchronizes metadata from your SQL Server databases into the data lineage graph.

  Your database will need to be accessible from wherever you are running the
  Grai server. If you are using Grai Cloud your database will need to be
  accessible from the internet.

## Python Library

### Installation

You'll need to first install the ODBC drivers for SQL Server before installing the SQL Server integration.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  If you're on a mac these can be installed with `brew install unixodbc`. If
  you're using Apple Silicon and encounter any issues running or installing the
  drivers we have some additional support documentation
  [here](https://github.com/grai-io/grai-core/tree/master/grai-integrations/source-mssql)
</Callout>

```shell copy
pip install grai-source-mssql
```

This installs the Grai SQL Server integration, which is now ready to run in python.

### Connecting & Syncing

The integration comes equipped with the client library already but we will need a python terminal or Jupyter Notebook to execute a few commands to establish a connection and begin querying the server.

Spin up your favorite python terminal then:

```python copy
import os
from grai_source_mssql.base import update_server
```

For now we will use the default user credentials though you are free to create a new user / api keys from the server admin interface at http://localhost:8000/admin.

```python copy
client = ClientV1("localhost","8000")
client.set_authentication_headers("null@grai.io","super_secret")
```

Now we can update the server with data from any mssql source. In order to do so you will need to pass credentials and namespace into the update_server function. Namespace is used to uniquely identify the nodes and when used consistently will allow you to add to the node from any source.

Using example variables, in order to update the server with your metadata, simply run:

```python copy
update_server(client, host=[your_mssql_host], user=[your_mssql_user], password=[your_mssql_password], namespace=[your_grai_namespace])
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  There are other option parameters like database, protocol, and port which are
  also available. More detail about ODBC connection string arguments are
  available from
  [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/odbc/dsn-connection-string-attribute?view=sql-server-ver16)
