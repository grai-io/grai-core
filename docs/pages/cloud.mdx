# About Grai Cloud Setup

Grai Cloud is the easiest way to get started using Grai.
It is a hosted version of Grai managed by the Grai team.
Because it's actively managed, it is always running the latest version of Grai including the latest features and bug fixes.



<Callout type="warning" emoji="ℹ️">
    To get started using the cloud visit the [registration](https://app.grai.io/register) page and create an account.
    It's free for small teams and individuals.

## Getting Started

Because Grai Cloud is a hosted version of Grai, you may need to provision access to some resources in your cloud provider.
