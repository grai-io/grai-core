# Client

The client library provides a programmatic interface to the various REST endpoints on the server.
With it you can build rich tooling on top of your existing installation of Grai.

## Installation

Install dbt Grai package with pip

```shell copy
pip install grai-client
```

## Usage

Most interactions with the server will start with a client instance like so

```python copy
from grai_client.endpoints.v1.client import ClientV1

client = ClientV1(host='api.grai.io', port='443', insecure=True)
client.set_authentication_headers(username='[your_username]', password='[your_password]')
```

Now that you have an instance of a client and have authenticated the client with the server
you can begin playing with the library.
It offers the start REST verb interface of `GET`, `POST`, `DELETE`, and `PATCH`. e.g.

```python copy
# Gets a list of nodes in your lineage graph
client.get('nodes')
```

Each verb operation can take a variety of arguments like `node`, `edge`, and `workspace`
but is primarily designed to work with structured objects from the `grai_schemas` library.
For example, if you wanted to create a new node in your lineage you could do the following

```python copy
from grai_schemas.v1 import NodeV1

my_node = NodeV1.from_spec({
    'name': 'node01',
    'namespace': 'default',
    'is_active': True,
    'data_source': 'dbt',
    'display_name': 'A Super Cool Node',
})

client.post(my_node)
```
