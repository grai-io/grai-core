description: Grai github actions which can be used to test your data pipeline

> grai-actions runs inside the Github action, alternatively see [Github Actions Server](./github-actions-server) which runs on the server.

Grai allows you to run a test of your data changes in git using github actions.

In your repository, create a yaml file at `/.github/workflows/main.yml`
and populate the file with your action parameters.

The full documentation for supported actions can be found in [GitHub](https://github.com/grai-io/grai-actions)
The example below works with postgres though there are equivalent implementations for
each other integration including dbt, MySQL, snowflake, etc...


``` yaml
on: pull_request

jobs:
  test:
    name: Evaluate local actions
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: prod data
        uses: grai-io/grai-actions/postgres@master
        with:
          api-key: '[your grai api key]'
          namespace: '[integration namespace]'
          db-host: '[host for your grai instance]'
          db-port: '[port for your grai instance]'
          db-user: '[database user]'
          db-password: '[database user password]'
```
