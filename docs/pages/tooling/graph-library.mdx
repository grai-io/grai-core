# Graph Library

Dynamically interact with the data lineage graph for your organization.

```shell copy
pip install grai-graph
```

### Lineage Exploration

You can now run deeper exploration and counterfactuals using the python library. First import the library, including graph, analysis and visualizations.

```python copy
from grai_graph import graph, analysis, visualizations
```

#### Counterfactuals

You can now run several counterfactual analyses from the graph library. These allow you to see the downstream impact of changes **before** they impact your dashboards and jobs.

For instance maybe we wanted to find out all of the data which would be impacted by deleting the id column on the lineage_node table.

```python copy
affected_nodes = analysis.test_delete_node(namespace='default', name='public.lineage_node.id')
for node in affected_nodes:
    print(node.spec.name)
```

Or to test changing the data type from uuid to int.

```python copy
nodes = analysis.test_type_change(namespace='default', name='public.lineage_node.id', new_type='int')
for node in nodes:
    print(node.spec.name)
```

You can also determine what nodes are downstream from a particular node:

```python copy
downstream_nodes = analysis.downstream_nodes(namespace='default', name='public.lineage_node.id')
for node in downstream_nodes:
    print(node.spec.name)
```
