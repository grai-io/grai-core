# CLI

The CLI library provides access to data lineage directly from the console.
It also allows you to manually create, update, and delete Nodes and Edges from yaml files.

Install the CLI and configure your default server credentials (they will be the same as the credentials used for the Client).

Grai uses OS specific search paths to find it's configuration file

- **macOS**: `~/.config/grai` and `~/Library/Application Support/grai`
- **Unix**: `~/.config/grai` and `/etc/grai`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\grai` where the APPDATA environment variable falls back to `%HOME%\AppData\Roaming` if undefined

```shell copy
pip install grai-cli
grai config init
```

To confirm that your settings are working with your server:

```shell copy
grai client is_authenticated
```

The Grai CLI has a range of commands to explore your data. For more details type

```shell copy
grai --help
```

To apply a configuration by file name:

```shell copy
grai apply <file name>
```

You can also use the flag --d for a dry run before committing your changes.

To adjust or view config settings which were set above use the config command, for instance to view your settings:

```shell copy
grai config view
```

To get details about your lineage, such as querying for nodes and edges, use "grai get [noun]".
For example, if you wanted to query for all of the nodes in your graph you would type

```shell copy
grai get nodes
```

or if you wanted to search for a specific node named "customer.name" you would instead

```shell copy
grai get nodes customer.name
```
