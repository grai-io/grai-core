# Slack Channel

Everyone is welcome on the community [slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/graicommunity/shared_invite/zt-1il70kfeb-TaCm5fwHg_quWCpKNYyj6w).
It's a great place to ask questions, get support, and join a communtiy of like minded data professionals.



# Discussions page

We also maintain an active discussions page on [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/grai-io/discussions) where you can ask questions, make suggestions, and get support.
We prioritize future integration development based on user feedback on the feature request page and are always looking for new ideas.

## How to use the Discussions page

Because we use GitHub issues exclusively for bug tracking we ask that you use the discussions page for all other questions and suggestions.
You can find links to a few different categories here or on the discussions page.

* [**Documentation Requests**](https://github.com/orgs/grai-io/discussions/categories/documentation-requests)
