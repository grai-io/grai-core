# Clone the Repository

The first step towards contributing to Grai is to clone [our repository](https://github.com/grai-io/grai-core).
Clones are copies of the project source code which include everything you'll need to run and use Grai.

## SSH Configuration

If you have SSH configured you can clone the repository by running the following command in your terminal.

```shell copy
git clone git@github.com:grai-io/grai-core.git grai-core
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    If you receive a `Permission denied` error you may need to configure SSH key access on GitHub.
    You can find details on how to do that [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/troubleshooting-ssh/error-permission-denied-publickey)

## HTTPS

If you're unable to use the SSH method you can fallback on https with the following command

```shell copy
git clone https://github.com/grai-io/grai-core.git grai-core
```
